# Song-Genre-Predictor-
This algorithm will predict the genre of a song base on the songs characterists and attributes

Our goal was to build a model that would predict the song based on attributes of that particular song. We did this by first importing packages such as numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib etcâ€¦ Then we got the number of genres that the data provided and transformed this categorical data into numerical data by using Label Encoder. It was crucial to use Label Encoder because this package allows us to keep the names of the genres. Since genre is what we are trying to predict we set genre to our Y and the rest of our data was assigned for our X. We used different classifiers to figure what the best model would be.
